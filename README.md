# Fold and cut visualization (disk-packing method)

I'm not actually sure whether or not this is possible, but I'm attempting to build a visualization and solution to [this version of the fold and cut theorem](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/OSME2001b/).

Currently this version is a hard-coded square. It's untested, but I think it should work for several very simple shapes. However, this solution is extremely simplistic to the extent that it should not be considered a solution in any way. Work in progress.
